# BI-PA2-Semestral-work -- Pacman | 2023

Hi, this is my Pac-man game, which was created as a result of my semestral work for a BI-PA2 programming course.

## How to lanuch:
1. Download the whole project file
2. Go to the project directory
3. Use 'make all' to generate the necessary files, including the binary file
4. Run the binary file with 'make run'

* optional: you can also use 'make doc' and 'make deps' to generate other supporting files
